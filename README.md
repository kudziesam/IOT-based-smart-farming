# IOT-based-smart-farming
Smart farming is a management concept focused on providing the agricultural industry with the infrastructure to leverage advanced technology – including big data, the cloud, machine learning and the internet of things (IoT) – for tracking, monitoring, automating and analysing operations. Also known as precision farming, smart farming is software-managed and sensor-monitored.
